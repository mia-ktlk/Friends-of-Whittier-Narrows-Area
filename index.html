                        Mountains to the ocean.  This Natural Area has over 300 species of birds.  It was described by a local woman as, 
                        “Our Yosemite.”  A young local man said when he visited, he was in awe to see more than one tree together like a forest.  
                        Before that, he had only seen a tree in a person’s yard.  Local people had grown up visiting this little piece of natural area,
                        open space, with their families.   The location has hosted innumerable field trips for schools and groups like Boy Scouts.  
                        It is the location of Mexican American history.  It is the first Audubon Center  west of the Mississipi. 
                        It is an outdoor classroom for flora and fauna.  Finally, the Kizh, San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians calls it their historical sacred land.

                        In the fall of 2006 Grace Allen, president of the WNNC Associates informed  of an agency who was planning to demolish the Whittier Narrows Nature Center and 
                        replace it with a new building which they would be called the San Gabriel  River Discovery Center  (DC).  Simultaneously, they would destroy at least 29 trees 
                        that were in their way.  In later stages, they would destroy more trees.

                        They recruited Dr Jack Bath, Biologist, and me, James Odling, Biologist, to try to stop this project.  We went to the Scoping Meeting in the fall of 2006.   
                        At first, we were an informal group.  But in 2007 we thought we needed a law suit to stop them.  Then we formed a nonprofit, Friends of Whittier Narrows Natural Area (Friends)  
                        so people would see we were serious in  Aug 2007. 
                        During these years  Friends continued to provide information to the community.  Friends organized at WN:   Art shows, Poetry reading, community picnics, 2015 informational pickets,
                        Spoke at schools.  On Earth Days away, we had tables where we presented information about WN.  The DC officials threatened us and told us to leave.  We informed them of our free speech 
                        rights and stayed.  We participated on a speaker on danger of mosquitos in wetland by a Vector specialist.
                        We also assisted in the river cleanup sponsored by the NC Associates and others.

                      SEATAC.   In 2007 to 2008 the Significant Ecological Area Technical Advisory  Committee  was meeting on if they would or not recommend the project.  On May 5, 2008 they voted not to 
                      recommend the project after several  meetings.  Dr  Jack said Gloria Molina had said she would abide by their decision.  The DC had thought they were going to win this; they had thought 
                      it a perfunctory step and one they had assured themselves had an outcome in their favor.  
                      In July of 2009 there were the CEQA hearings at the South El Monte High School.  We hired a lawyer  Marcia Wertenberger.  
                      Throughout this period we were going to DC  board meetings regularly.  We began to video the meetings and post excerpts of them to youtube channels.  
                      It was a good idea because they could not dispute recorded information for the public to see.

                        SOUTH EL MONTE HIGH SCHOOL AND RIO HONDO STUDENTS.  From the beginning, we had participation from Rio Hondo students. 
                        The high school had formed the Emerald Necklace club on campus and developed a petition against the DC’s development at WN.
                        KIZH BAND OF SAN GABRIEL MISSION INDIANS.  In 2010 the Kizh became part of the efforts to save their sacred land at WN.  Margo
                        was instrumental in informing them of the threat. DC.  On January 20, 2010 the D C voted to build the preferred alternative:   14,000 sq ft facility and 114 space parking lot.   
                        In the vote, they overload the following:   destruction of existing natural area, affecting endangered birds, use of more global water, and contributing to climate change.   
                        Their rationalization was that it was more  “important for the children.”
                        CEQA.  That’s when we began our CEQA suit.  In 2011 we handed in a petition against the DC signed by 1100 people to the DC.  
                        At the same time they were setting up staged meetings at campuses, meetings  not discussed at Board meetings so that they could keep the information from us. 
                        But, we found out anyway because we kept tabs on the internet announcements posted at the last minute.

                        Feb 2011 was the day of the trial.  We had a new lawyer:  Frank Angel.    We were the plaintiff and the DC  was the respondent.  The  DC was led by the Margaret Sahagi law firm.  
                        On their team in the courtroom is Executive Director for both  the DC and the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy, Belinda Faustinos.  She had beens recently elected to CA Audubon Board.  
                        The area for building is within the same area for at least one endangered species.  Audubon considers the area  an important birding area.  But Faustinos proposed paving and building on habitat for the Least Bells Vireo, 
                        an endangered species, and Important  Birding Area.  Several  birds were also classified as “threatened” and “of concern,” per a report by Mickey Long, leading County Biologist for Parks, in 1998 and 1995.  Ann Croissant was part of that study.
                        In the court that day evidence that  judge John Toribio and the lawyer Sahagi had happy talk regarding her change of name before the session began.  During the court session, our lawyer presented information about the endangered bird. 
                        Judge Toribio said why stop this “good” project for “one little bird.”  When the hearing was over, lawyer Sahagi said to the judge, “Say hello to Amanda.”  The judge decided for the DC.  We did not appeal because of the cost and two of the three panels that we would be assigned were pro development.
